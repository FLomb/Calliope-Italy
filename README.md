# Calliope-Italy
Calliope-based 20-node representation of the Italian electric energy system.

## Requirements
Calliope version 0.6.3

## Versions
[Work in progress]

Current version is v.0.21. To run the model, use the nos_model_run.py script. The post_process.py script is instead aimed at picking the most interesting NOS among the large amount generated, yet, due to the rapid version updating, it is still not perfectly aligned with the latests changes in the other scripts and might not work as expected.
