# Calliope-Italy
Calliope-based 20-region representation of the Italian electric energy system, including both current and 2050 technological options.
The model also features the possibility to generate *spatially-explicit practically-optimal results* (SPORES).

## Requirements
The model is built on the Python-based open-source energy modelling framework Calliope, version 0.6.4. 

To run the model, it is recommended to follow the [instructions for installing Calliope](https://calliope.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installation.html).

## Overview
All input data are and model specification are in the Model folder. In particular, timeseries data are in the 'timeseries_data' sub-folder, whilst location and tech specifications are the 'model_config' sub-folder.

To run the model over a week of data for testing:
- select the 'subset_time' of interest in the model.yaml file
- run the spores_model_run.py file

Please notice that *all timeseries are indexed to 2015 for convention* (this was the year originally used to test the model against TSO data), but the actual weather year is 2016 in the reference scenario - and any year in the range 1981-2016 can be selected from the folder "*paper_scenarios/full_list_of_weather_years*". Further details are provided in "*paper_scenarios/nomenclature.md*".
